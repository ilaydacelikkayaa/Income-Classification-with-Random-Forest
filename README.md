### About the Project
This project applies the **Random Forest Classifier** algorithm on the "Income Evaluation" dataset.  
The goal is to predict whether a person's income is above 50K or not.  

The project includes the following steps:
- Data loading and descriptive analysis  
- Analysis of missing and outlier values  
- Encoding categorical variables (Target Encoding, One-Hot Encoding)  
- Applying scaling methods (RobustScaler)  
- Training and evaluation of the Random Forest model  
- Analysis of feature importances  

### Technologies Used
- Python 3.x  
- pandas, numpy  
- scikit-learn  
- matplotlib, seaborn  

### Results
The performance of the model is evaluated with accuracy, precision, recall and F1 scores.  
Feature importance analysis shows which variables contribute the most to the predictions.
